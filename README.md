# PRODIGY_ML_01
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This project, assigned by Prodigy, aims to build a robust predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features. By leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to deliver accurate predictions and valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices.

#### Objectives
Develop a predictive model to estimate house prices.
Utilize stepwise regression to select significant features.
Implement significance testing to ensure the reliability of the model.
Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it for better accuracy.
Stepwise Regression and Significance Testing
## Stepwise Regression
Stepwise regression is a systematic method for adding and removing variables in a regression model to identify the most significant features. This technique involves the following steps:

- Forward Selection: Start with no variables in the model, test the addition of each variable using a chosen model selection criterion (e.g., AIC, BIC), and add the variable that improves the model the most. Repeat this process until no further improvements are possible.

- Backward Elimination: Start with all candidate variables in the model, test the deletion of each variable, and remove the variable that improves the model the most. Repeat this process until no further deletions are beneficial.

- Bidirectional Elimination: A combination of forward selection and backward elimination, where variables are added and removed based on their contribution to the model.

## Significance Testing
Significance testing is used to determine whether the features included in the model are statistically significant predictors of the target variable (house prices). Common methods include:

- p-value: A measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance. Typically, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.
- t-statistic: A ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter from its hypothesized value to its standard error.
- By using these methods, we ensure that the features retained in the model are truly contributing to the prediction accuracy.

## Project Features
The project includes several key features and steps:

Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of houses such as location, size, number of bedrooms, age, and other relevant factors.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure all data is in a usable format.

Feature Selection: Implement stepwise regression to identify the most significant features influencing house prices. Use significance testing to validate these features.

Model Building: Develop the predictive model using the selected features. Common algorithms used might include linear regression, decision trees, or more advanced machine learning models.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²),The model achieved an R² score of 0.83, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting house prices..

Model Tuning: Fine-tune the model parameters to improve accuracy and reliability.

Prediction and Analysis: Use the final model to make predictions on house prices and analyze the results to provide insights.
